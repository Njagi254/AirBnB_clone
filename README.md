# AirBnB_clone
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
This repository contains the initial stage my student project to build the AirBnB website clone. 
At this stage I am implementing a backend interface, or Console, to manage program data.
Console commands allow the user to CREATE, UPDATE, and DESTROY objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.

COMMAND INTERPRETER 
The command interpreter is the core of the application. It is responsible for accepting and parsing user input, and executing the corresponding actions.

STARTING THE COMMAND INTERPRETER 
To start the command interpreter run the followin command in your terminal:
$ ./console.py

Once the console is running you can enter commands to manipulate objects in the database using the following basic commands : 
Such as create, show, destroy, all, update class :
Describing name of the class objects you want to manage id :
ID of the object attributes:
Attributes you want to create or update

EXAMPLES Example 0: Create an object Usage: create Basemodel
creating folders
